JÃ¶rg Hoh recently wrote [an interesting post on Content Architecture](https://cqdump.wordpress.com/2018/09/10/content-architecture-dealing-with-relations/) where he discussed how expensive JCR Queries could instead be replaced with targeted content structure traversals to allow finding relevant content without searching the whole AEM repository. Unfortunately, from a developer perspective, this means writing a fair amount of boilerplate code to traverse the AEM repository and then identify the relevant Resources.  

Fortunately, a new API was just released by the Apache Sling team. This API was created by [Jason Bailey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-e-bailey/) and adds support for using Lambda expressions to filter a stream of Resources in from Sling repository.

This new [Resource Filter API](https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-resource-filter) allows AEM / Sling developers to be significantly more succinct and readable and how they perform common repository traversals. It's not a pure replacement of JCR queries or or the traditional method of traversing the repository, but for simple content structures you can do a lot more with a lot less code.

  
## Resource Filter Example  

  
Here's an example of how one could extract a stream of resources by a page's component type under a cq:Page:

  

```java
log.info("Filtering by type: {}", type);
ResourceFilterStream resourceStream = resource.adaptTo(ResourceFilterStream.class);
resourceStream.setBranchSelector("[jcr:primaryType] == 'sling:Page'")
	.setChildSelector("[jcr:content/sling:resourceType] == $type")
	.addParam("type", type).stream()
	.forEach(r -> {
		builder.add(r.getPath());
		log.info(r.getPath());
	});
```

  
In this example, we are just writing the resource to a JSON Array using the javax.json API, but once you have a stream of Resources, you can use any Lambda function to then process or further filter the stream.

  
## Adding the Resource Filter API in your Project

  
Adding the Resource Filter API into your project takes two steps. First add the dependency into your project's POM:

  

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.sling</groupId>
    <artifactId>org.apache.sling.resource.filter</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

  
Once you have your code developed, you can [add the Resource Filter bundle into your package build](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-add-third-party-bundle-you-aem-package-veena-vikraman/).
