The new version of CQ5, [Adobe Experience Manager 5.6](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/web-experience-management.html "Adobe Experience Manager"), includes a contribution by Six Dimensions to the [Apache Sling](http://sling.apache.org/ "Apache Sling") project. This contribution adds a new method, [getChildren](http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/javadoc/org/apache/sling/api/resource/Resource.html#getChildren%28%29) to the Resource interface. 

> Now getChildren() in the Resource-API, available in AEM5.6 thanks to @[klcodanr](https://twitter.com/klcodanr) [#sling](https://twitter.com/search/%23sling) [#cq5](https://twitter.com/search/%23cq5) [#aem](https://twitter.com/search/%23aem) [dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/cur…](http://t.co/b9r1H1nD42 "http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/javadoc/org/apache/sling/api/resource/Resource.html")

This method allows you to use for-each loops to iterate through child resources and allows access the children of a resource using Expression Language and TagLibs. For more information on this API change, please read [New in Apache Sling: getChildren](/posts/2012-11-new-apache-sling-getchildren).
