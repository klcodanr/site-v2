Monday evening I was pinged an alert on Outlook that it was time for Perficient's annual pre-Summit dinner, the first time I've not been to Las Vegas in March since Summit moved from Salt Lake City.

While I am glad that Adobe has taken measures for the safety of our community, colleagues and family, I will miss meeting up with you at Adobe Summit 2020\. 

As we cannot meet up in person, Adobe has re-launched [Adobe Summit as an online experience](https://www.adobe.com/summit.html). Now we can watch all of the Adobe-goodness at our leisure. If only we were stuck inside with nothing better to do...

To help you keep busy during the quarantine, I've put together a list of my themes for Summit 2020 and the top videos I'm going to be watching!  
  
## Theme #1: End of Cookies

  
Safari represents [56% of mobile browser visitors in the US,](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/mobile/united-states-of-america/#monthly-201902-202002) so if you care about mobile visitors [ITP](https://webkit.org/blog/9521/intelligent-tracking-prevention-2-3/) is already the reality. Even if not, Chrome, which represents [65% of the global browser market share](https://gs.statcounter.com/), is announced [similar measures](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/05/improving-privacy-and-security-on-web.html) coming soon. Clearly, relying on 3rd party cookies is not a winning strategy, so what do we do next?

###   

## Theme #2: The Next Generation of Content Management

  
I've been working with Adobe Experience Manager for a long time and frankly, while Adobe has been making iterative investments and UI changes, the tool is recognizably similar to how it was 10 years ago. Now with [AEM as a Cloud Service](https://blogs.perficient.com/2020/01/13/thoughts-on-aem-as-a-cloud-service/), Adobe is changing the game and I for one am very interested to see where they are going.  
  
* [Top innovations: Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service](https://www.adobe.com/summit/2020/top-innovations-adobe-experience-manager-as-a-cloud-service.html)
  
In addition to AEM as a Cloud Service, there's also some great AEM Classic vs Cloud Service agnostic content:

## Theme #3: Get the Most out of Adobe Analytics

  
I always enjoy seeing what other practitioners and organizations are doing with Adobe Analytics, this year there are some great sessions around getting the most out of Adobe Analytics.

## Theme #4: Adobe Experience Platform

  
Adobe Experience Platform represents the next generation of customer data management and orchestration on the Adobe Experience Cloud. I'm excited to see the promise meet reality.

## And of course: Sneaks!

  
Sneaks is always my favorite session at Adobe Summit, who doesn't like seeing cool stuff and technologists heckled by comedians? The hardest things about sneaks is realizing the cool stuff you saw won't be available immediately.
