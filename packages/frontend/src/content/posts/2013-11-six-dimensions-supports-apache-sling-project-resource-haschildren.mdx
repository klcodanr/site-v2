Recently, I had the chance to shepherd a [new feature](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-3213) into the Apache Sling API. This feature adds the method `hasChildren` to the [Resource](http://sling.apache.org/apidocs/sling6/org/apache/sling/api/resource/Resource.html) and [ResourceResolver](http://sling.apache.org/apidocs/sling6/org/apache/sling/api/resource/ResourceResolver.html). My colleague, [Brian Warner](https://twitter.com/Brian%5FA%5FWarner) suggested adding this method after struggling to do this in a clean, correct way.

What’s new? The hasChildren method is a convenient shortcut for developers to check whether or not a Resource has child resources. This method returns correctly across different Resource Providers unlike the lower-level API’s such as [Node.hasNodes()](http://www.day.com/maven/javax.jcr/javadocs/jcr-1.0/javax/jcr/Node.html). And this method enables developers to check for child Resources easily and intuitively, for example:

```
if(resource.hasChildren()){
	// DO SOMETHING
}

```

The feature has been added into the Sling codebase, but there is not yet a new release of the Sling API, but this feature will likely make it into CQ6 and I will update this post once the new method becomes available.
