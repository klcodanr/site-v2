Adobe's acquisition of Marketo brings exciting opportunities to extend Adobe's considerable marketing capabilities with a tightly integrated B2B and ABM solution. As a leading partner of both Adobe and Marketo, Perficient is leading the push to integrate these solutions.

One of the main integration points between AEM and Marketo is via [Marketo's JavaScript forms.](https://developers.marketo.com/javascript-api/forms/) We built a component to integrate Marketo JavaScript forms into AEM and [contributed](https://github.com/Adobe-Consulting-Services/acs-aem-commons/pull/2064) it into ACS AEM Commons so now you can add Marketo forms into AEM pages as simply as adding and editing any other component.

## Installing the Marketo Form Embed AEM Component

  
The Marketo Form Embed Component is implemented as a [AEM WCM Core Components Embed Embeddable](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-core-components/using/components/embed.html) and therefore requires the following dependencies:  

* [AEM WCM Core Components 2.7.0+](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-wcm-components/releases)
* [ACS AEM Commons 4.4.0+](https://github.com/Adobe-Consulting-Services/acs-aem-commons/releases)

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can use the Marketo Form Embed on any page you have enabled the Marketo Cloud Configuration.  
  

## Using the Marketo Form Embed AEM Component

  
The Marketo Form Embed AEM Component allows you to search and select from the forms available in Marketo. But the Marketo Form Embed can do far more than just embedding a form, you can set the redirect URL, set variables and even add custom scripts.   
  
Read more on using the Marketo Form Embed on the [ACS AEM Commons website](https://adobe-consulting-services.github.io/acs-aem-commons/features/marketo-form/index.html).
