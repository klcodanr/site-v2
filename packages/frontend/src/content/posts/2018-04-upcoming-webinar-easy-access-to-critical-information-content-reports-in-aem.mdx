### Itâ€™s almost time!

In just under a week, on April 24th, I will be presenting at the next Ask the Community Expert session about AEM Content Reports. I previously covered AEM Content Reports in my post [New From Perficient Digital: Content Reports in AEM](https://blogs.perficient.com/adobe/2018/01/25/new-perficient-digital-content-reports-aem/). 

This webinar will go deeper and show you how to use this powerful new feature in ACS AEM Commons. The webinar will include a virtual walkthrough and demo of using, configuring and customizing AEM Content Reports. 

If you manage a content team, are a product owner for an AEM project or just want to stop having to extract data from CRXDE Lite, this webinar is for you!
