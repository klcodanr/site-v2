The current release of VaultClipse (0.2.4) is not compatible with VLT 2.4.18, which was released with CQ 5.5\. A new release of VaultClipse, with a fix for this issue is, in progress and is expected to be released this week.

In the meantime, please use the 2.3.x versions of VLT, which were released with CQ 5.5.

Thank you for your patience!
