I'm proud to announce the release of AEM DataLayer version 0.3.0\. This version includes:  
  
* Support for AEM 6.4 and 6.5 (beta)
* Improved (and less verbose) logging
* Changing from Gson to Johnzon for JSON Serialization
For more details on using the AEM DataLayer, please consult the [release notes](https://github.com/PerficientDigital/AEM-DataLayer/releases/tag/0.3.0).  
  
## Using the AEM DataLayer on Your Project

  
The AEM DataLayer allows developers to easily expose data about backed services, AEM pages and components to Digital Marketing tools via a neutral data layer. Integrating it into your project is as simple as the following steps:  
  
* Install the AEM DataLayer Package
* Configure AEM DataLayer
* Setup the Cloud Configuration
I created an Adobe Spark Video to[ walk through the process](https://spark.adobe.com/video/RE9fXgcyYVTrC).  
  
From there, you create classes to bind the data from the data sources to the data layer using the [simple API](http://blogs.adobe.com/contentmanagement/2017/04/18/be-an-aemrockstar-use-aem-datalayer/).
