The Six Dimensions Labs team is proud to introduce version 0.1.3 of CQ Deploy, an [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) plugin for deploying Maven projects into Adobe CQ repositories.

The CQ Deploy plugin allows developers deploy CQ projects using Maven in an easy and consistant manner. The CQ Deploy Plugin is capable of deploying both packages and bundles and is compatible with CQ 5.2-5.5.

The current release, version 0.1.3 brings:

* Added unit tests to test failure results
* Added support for optional install properties.
* Fixed issues where the legacy installer required the user to set the path or it would upload, but not install the package.
* Improved handling of errors when the legacy package manager installs a bundle with invalid XML.

You can read more about CQ Deploy on the [documentation website](http://sixdimensions.github.com/cq-deploy-plugin/ "CQ Deploy - Maven Plugin for Deploying CQ Projects").
