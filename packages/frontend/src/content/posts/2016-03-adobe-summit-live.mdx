#### Are you excited for Adobe Summit? I know I am!

![Adobe Summit 2016!](/images/posts/2016-03-17-adobe-summit-live/Adobe-Summit.png) 

We're now down to the last few days before Adobe Summit starts on March 22nd and I'm getting my bags packed.

This year, I'm bringing something new: **a video camera!** Every day, I'll be sharing a video of my thoughts, insights and views on what I've learned at Adobe Summit. Joining me will be a collection of my colleagues, comerades and partners.

I'll be posting at least one video a day for the duration of Adobe Summit, so make sure to stay tuned in to get the freshest scoop of industry insights, reactions and the latest news from Adobe Summit.
