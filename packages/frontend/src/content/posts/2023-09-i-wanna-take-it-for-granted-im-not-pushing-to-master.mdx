Sometimes when I accidentally push to the wrong branch in git, things get so crazy I want to [head to the beach and play guitar at you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJLgKXp375I):

> I just want to push code around,  
> Well, I will, well, I will  
> I don't wanna push to master  
> No, I don't, no, I don't  
> I wanna take it for granted  
> Yeah, I wanna take it for granted  
> Well, I will, well, I will

But seriously, there are few things more annoying than realizing that you accidentally pushed code to the main / master branch instead of a PR branch, especially when branch protection is not enabled for a repository.  
  
Frustratingly, this has happened to me a few times recently, so I wrote a [pre-push hook](https://gist.github.com/klcodanr/9cb36294d9e76c0b392b3209241ad900#file-pre-push) to warn me if I'm about to push into a branch with a name containing main, master or release.  
  
The hook is enabled globally, so if I'm working on a project and try to push to main, I get a warning like:

As it's a warning, I can still allow the push to continue by pressing Y, but most of the time the warning is sufficient to avoid pushing to the wrong branch by accident.  
  
## How do I get it?

  
You can install the hook from the Github Gist with the following commands:

  

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.githooks
curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/klcodanr/9cb36294d9e76c0b392b3209241ad900/raw/915f2d42d8dec5a52e1ce72b69e22d17925d6356/pre-push --output ~/.githooks/pre-push
chmod +x ~/.githooks/pre-push
git config --global core.hooksPath ~/.githooks/
```

  

Want to try it out first? You can run [this Dockerfile](https://gist.github.com/klcodanr/9cb36294d9e76c0b392b3209241ad900#file-dockerfile) to demo the functionality in the \~/local folder:

  

```bash
docker build . -t hook-test
docker run -it hook-test /bin/bash
```

  
Hopefully you find the pre-push hook as useful as I do. While ideally this is also enforced at the repository level, but especially when working on multiple legacy projects you can never be sure how the repositories are configured.
