I use [Apache Sling CMS](https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-app-cms) for [my personal site](/), so I can easily author my blog posts from [nearly anywhere](https://twitter.com/KlcoDanR/status/1245087689663275008). Unfortunately, since this is a personal site, I'm not exactly spending the dollars on building out a full Continuous Integration / Delivery process. 

  
## Enter GitHub Actions

  
GitHub provides [Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), a free for limited use solution for executing code on Git repository events. With GitHub Actions, I can set up a pipeline to automatically deploy my code on changes to the master branch.  
  
### Actions Pipeline Definition

  
The pipeline is defined as a YAML file, deploy.yaml, under the directory `.github.workflows` in my code repository.  
  

```yaml
# Deploys code updates to my personal site on push to the master branch

name: Deploy on Push
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up JDK 1.8
      uses: actions/setup-java@v1
      with:
        java-version: 1.8
        server-id: github
        settings-path: ${{ github.workspace }}
    - name: Build and Deploy
      run: mvn install -B -s $GITHUB_WORKSPACE/settings.xml -PautoInstallBundle,ci
      env:
        SLING_HOST: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_HOST }}
        SLING_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_USERNAME }}
        SLING_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_PASSWORD }}
        SLING_PROTOCOL: https
        SLING_PORT: 443
```

  
A few things to note about the pipeline definition:

* The definition `on` object contains my invocation definition, in this case, pushes to master
* In the Maven command, I've added a custom profile `ci`, this profile will copy the environment variables seen in the env object
* The env parameter to Build and Deploy contains the parameters, including [secret parameters](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) for deploying the code
  
### Keeping Secrets, Secret

  
In order to deploy my code, I have to provide the CMS authoring URL and the username / password for an Administrative user. Naturally, I don't want to put this information on the web. With GitHub Actions, I can create secrets within the project:

And then use the `ci` profile in the POM to copy those secrets as environment variables from the `env` parameter in the Github Actions pipeline into the Maven project properties.  
  

```xml
<profile>
    <id>ci</id>
    <properties>
        <sling.host>${env.SLING_HOST}</sling.host>
        <sling.port>${env.SLING_PORT}</sling.port>
        <sling.username>${env.SLING_USERNAME}</sling.username>
        <sling.password>${env.SLING_PASSWORD}</sling.password>
        <sling.protocol>${env.SLING_PROTOCOL}</sling.protocol>
    </properties>
</profile>
```

  
Once this is all wired up, you can push in a small change to execute the pipeline and you should see the deployment succeed. Note that the secrets are hidden from the logs so even if a user can see the pipeline, they cannot see the secret values.

With Github Actions, you can not only host [a small Apache Sling CMS website for free](https://blogs.perficient.com/2018/12/11/building-a-zero-cost-website-with-apache-sling-cms/), but you can even have a reliable CI/CD process!
