I was perusing the [definition of a valid JCR name](https://www.adobe.io/experience-manager/reference-materials/spec/jcr/2.0/3%5FRepository%5FModel.html#3.2%20Names) and noticed that according to the JCR spec, most [Unicode](https://home.unicode.org/) characters are valid JCR name characters besides some enumerated exceptions. Including emojis...

\\ud83e\\udd2f

  
Naturally, I had to try it. I wrote up a quick [Groovy script](https://gist.github.com/klcodanr/d1b60ed084a05b6ef7839cc76022e783) to iterate all of the potential Unicode code points, check which ones were valid characters in Java and then try to create a node containing the character in the name.

On Apache Jackrabbit Oak 1.42.0, all except the following characters are allowed in names:

This is fun and all, but what good does it do for me practically? Well, since I'm using Sling CMS to create this page, it only uses the JCR for filtering node names. Thus, I can create an absurd URL like the one for this post: [/posts/2022/01/unicode-\\ud83e\\udd73-with-ɘHↄAqA -\\ud83d\\udc07-\\ud83c\\udd62\\ud83c\\udd5b\\ud83c\\udd58\\ud83c\\udd5d\\ud83c\\udd56.html](/posts/2022/01/unicode-\ud83e\udd73-with-ɘHↄAqA -\ud83d\udc07-\ud83c\udd62\ud83c\udd5b\ud83c\udd58\ud83c\udd5d\ud83c\udd56.html). More practically, I could use Unicode characters to create a page URL in a non-Latin language or create unique landing page urls with emojis.

More prudently, AEM has a more restrictive validation by default and only allows certain ASCII characters.   

![Error message setting an unsupported character](/images/posts/2022-01/AEM-Emoji.png)

  
AEM's Vanity URL property, however _does_ allow for any characters, so from there we can set our Emoji URL:  
  

![Set the Unicode Vanity URL in AEM Page Properties](/images/posts/2022-01/Set-Vanity.png)

  
And AEM will redirect / display the page we want:  
  

![Unicode Vanity URL](/images/posts/2022-01/Vanity-URL.png)

  

Practical? Probably not. Fun? Most definitely!
