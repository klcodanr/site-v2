I had a chance to present my #AEMRockstar winning presentation and Open Source Library[AEM DataLayer](https://github.com/PerficientDigital/AEM-DataLayer)at [Adobe's IMMERSE17 virtual conference](https://docs.adobe.com/dev/products/aem/events/0416.html).

This presentation expanded on my previous presentations and included a demonstration on how to setup and use the AEM DataLayer library.
