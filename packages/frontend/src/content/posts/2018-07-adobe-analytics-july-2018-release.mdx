Last week, Adobe rolled out the latest updates to [Adobe Analytics](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en%5FUS/whatsnew/#analytics), this release includes some _huge_ new features which will drastically help analysts report on meaningful insights using the wealth of data in Adobe Analytics. 

## Attribution IQ  

The paramount feature is [Attribution IQ](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en%5FUS/analytics/analysis-workspace/attribution.html). Attribution IQ allows marketers to select and compare different attribution models to determine the model that best represents their attribution channels. This new flexibility allows marketers and analysts to gather sophisticated insights into the performance of different marketing channels.

Attribution IQ is available for any metric in [Analysis Workspace](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en%5FUS/analytics/analysis-workspace/) and can be applied to any models in a breakdown report. [Trevor Paulsen](https://twitter.com/TrevorHPaulsen/) from the Adobe product team does a great job showing the flexibility of Attribution IQ and how it can be used to slice and dice data at an extremely granular level inside of the Attribution Panel.

Attribution IQ allows you to choose from the following pre-built [attribution models](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en%5FUS/analytics/analysis-workspace/attribution.html#concept%5F5BDCF631FCC841FF920FE07F1B0D08A2%5F%5Fsection%5F4B9E7F83AE0B451A992397E55C3F5871):

* Last Touch
* First Touch
* Linear
* Participation
* Same Touch
* U Shaped
* J Curve
* Inverse J
* Time Decay

Or to configure a custom model based on the weights you configure for the different attribution events:

You can use each of these models to report granular insights based on any metric in Adobe Analytics including segments, props and eVars using FreeForm tables:

An August 9th Adobe is hosting a [webinar on Attribution IQ for Adobe Partners](https://analytics180808.solutionpartners.adobeevents.com/) if you want to learn more about Attribution IQ. I'll see you there!

## Comparing Attribution Models

Having the ability to select and even create attribution models is cool, but how do you know which attribution model best fits your data and organization's channels? Since Attribute IQ models can be used with calculated metrics, you can compare the models using calculated metrics and even create composite models with calculated metrics.

## Configurable Visit Duration

Since the beginning of Adobe Analytics, we've been limited to a fixed duration for calculating visits. This works for most use cases, but how do you represent visitors for a 24-hour sale? Or identify long running visits? With the latest release of Adobe Analytics, you can now non-destructively configure the visit duration on your Analysis Workspace reports:

> But I wanted to call out the additional flexibility we've added to the tool in Virtual Report Suites. Get crazy with your visit definitions - think outside the 30 min visit definition from the 90s [pic.twitter.com/8kmm3iFvn1](https://t.co/8kmm3iFvn1)

## Improved Usage Monitoring

Usage in Adobe Analytics has historically been a black box, which makes it difficult to forecast or respond to overages. With the latest release of Adobe Analytics, you can view a detailed report of your Adobe Analytics usage, comparing it to your call limits and previous months usage. Additionally, you can create alerts to send email alerts if usage hits defined thresholds.
