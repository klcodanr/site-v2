I'm honored to be returning to compete in the 2019 AEM Rockstar along side the brightest minds in the Adobe Experience Manager community.   
  
This year, I will be presenting on publishing and managing conversational content to voice assistants using AEM Assets and the Adobe Experience Cloud. My brief talk will include an overview and demo of the solution, showing real-world use cases of how this technology can be applied to bring digital experience best practices to voice assistants.   
  
Looking forward to seeing you all in Las Vegas and at [AEM Rockstar 2019](https://aemrockstar2019.attendease.com/)!
