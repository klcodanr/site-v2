## adaptTo() 2021

_27th - 29th September 2021_

Closing out the summer, AdaptTo 2021 returns for it's 11th year and is expected to be a hybrid-virtual / in-person conference. Featuring many luminaries and guiding architects of the Apache Sling space, this conference is the best way to get the skinny on what's coming next in the Apache Sling ecosystem.

Due to this ongoing pandemic, only virtual tickets are being offered at this time, but hopefully soon in person will be offered as well. Register on [adapt.to](https://adapt.to/2021/en/tickets.html).
