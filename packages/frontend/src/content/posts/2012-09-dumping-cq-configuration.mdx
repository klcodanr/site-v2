Often when providing remote support, you may want to send a complete snapshot of a CQ instanceâ€™s configuration and state to others to help debugging. Generating a report of the complete status of the OSGi configuration, environment state and logs is as easy as invoking a single url. 

The OSGi console will generate a report of the following items when you invoke: `SERVER`:`PORT`/system/console/config/configuration-status.zip

* All Log Files
* Wire Admin
* Threads
* System Properties
* Sling Thread Pools
* Sling Settings
* Sling Servlet Filters
* Sling Scheduler Jobs
* Sling Resource Resolver Map Entries
* Sling Referrer Filters
* Sling Properties
* Sling Eventing Queue
* Available Sling Adaptors
* Services & their properties
* Registered Script Engines
* CRX Configuration
* Product/Licensing Information
* Preferences/Permissions (if Available)
* Java Package Admin
* Installed Bundles
* Memory Usage
* Log Configuraiton
* JMX/MBeans Configuration
* Http WhiteBoard
* GFX Information
* Declarative Services Components
* Configuraitons
* CQ4 Migration Configuration
* Bundle Information

You can also get a text file with the same information, except the log files, by invoking `SERVER`:`PORT`/system/console/config/configuration-status.txt.
