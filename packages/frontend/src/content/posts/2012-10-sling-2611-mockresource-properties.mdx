I recently [submitted a patch](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-2611) to the Apache Sling project. This patch includes new functionality for Commons Testingâ€™s MockResource class. The patch adds two methods:

* addProperty - add a single key, value set
* getProperties - returns the map of properties which can be modified

These methods allow developers to set arbitrary properties on a MockResource and then when the MockResource is adapted to a ValueMap, the ValueMap will contain these properties.
