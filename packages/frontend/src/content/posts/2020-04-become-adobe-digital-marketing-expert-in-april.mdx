In my previous post, [Locked Down? Learn AEM in April](https://blogs.perficient.com/2020/04/13/locked-down-learn-aem-in-april/), I talked about how [PluralSight's #FreeApril](https://www.pluralsight.com/offer/2020/free-april-month) program gives you access to great training on Adobe Experience Manager. 

For those of us also working with more than Content Management, #FreeApril provides some great training for you too! PluralSight has great courses on Adobe Analytics and Target for you to build expertise on these powerful solutions. Unfortunately, there's not a Pluralsight track on Launch, by Adobe so I pulled from the great free training Adobe has published on YouTube for this integral Tag Management solution.   
  
## Getting a Sandbox

  
To use Analytics and Target you will need a Sandbox or non-Production instance. If your organization already has Adobe, reach out to whomever manages the access to the Adobe Experience Cloud, if not, you can request a copy from Adobe.
