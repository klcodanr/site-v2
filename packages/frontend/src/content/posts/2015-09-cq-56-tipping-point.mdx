 Recently, I spent a bit of time running performance tests against various versions of CQ5/AEM to understand the performance characteristics of the different versions. One of the interesting outcomes of this testing is that CQ 5.6 and before have a very distinct point at which the instance becomes unstable.

 To evaluate the performance characteristics of AEM, I used an AWS m4.xLarge EC2 instance and Apache Benchmark to simulate traffic against a consistent baseline. 

 AEM 6.0 and 6.1 were able to scale up to 1000 concurrent requests without significant errors as illustrated in the graph below:

 CQ5.6 however ran into serious problems at approximately 400 concurrent requests and experienced a high and increasing error rate as the concurrency continued to increase.

 So why is this the case? In AEM 6.0, Adobe introduce the new [CRX3 repository which is based on Jackrabbit OAK](http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-0/deploy/upgrade/introduction-to-oak.html). This new repository implementation provides significant performance improvements over CRX2.

 I found out a number of other particularities when comparing the performance of CQ 5.6 and AEM 6.1, for a complete report, including analysis and recommendations:
