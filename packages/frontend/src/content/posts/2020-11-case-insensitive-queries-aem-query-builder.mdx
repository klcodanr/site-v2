Recently, I needed to perform a query using the AEM Query Builder which was case insensitive. While I normally prefer using [JCR SQL2 queries](/posts/2014/10/9-jcr-sql-2-queries-every-aem-dev-should-know.html), in this case Query Builder was a better fit as I wanted consuming applications to be able to manipulate the query and doing so as a map is significantly easier than doing so as a string.

I was surprised to find that there was no native Query Builder Predicate for doing case insensitive queries so I ended up writing my own. 

The predicate works by lower casing the value and then using the XPath fn:lower-case method to compare to the field value in lower case.

        Locale locale = Optional.ofNullable(predicate.get(PREDICATE_LOCALE)).map(lt -> Locale.forLanguageTag(lt))
                .orElse(Locale.getDefault());
        String value = predicate.get(PREDICATE_VALUE).toLowerCase(locale).replace("'", "''");
        String query = String.format("fn:lower-case(@%s)='%s'", property, value);
        log.debug("Generated query: {}", query);
        return query;
    }
}
```

  
Once the custom predicate is available in your application, it can be used in any Query Builder query as such:  
  

```
path=/content/test
equalsIgnoreCase.property=test
equalsIgnoreCase.value=test
equalsIgnoreCase.locale=en_US
```

  
The locale parameter is not required, but would generally be recommended unless the input will always be in the system default locale.
