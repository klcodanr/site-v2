At Perficient and in my household, our kids and friend's kids are learning from home. While balancing the needs to keep ourselves and our families happy and healthy we have to ask ourselves, what comes next after these unprecedented times?

For those of us in the Digital Marketing space, the best way to manage this downturn is build our skills and value with our own learning. Whether you are laid off or slowed down, having additional value will give you an edge up.
