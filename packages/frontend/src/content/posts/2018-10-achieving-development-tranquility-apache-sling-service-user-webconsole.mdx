In my previous post, [Introducing Apache Sling 10](https://blogs.perficientdigital.com/2018/02/06/announcing-apache-sling-10/), I discussed some of the new features released with Apache Sling 10, the latest release of the Apache Sling Starter. One feature, however seemed to get lost in the discussion, the Apache Sling Service User WebConsole is a great tool for any AEM developer and will make the process of creating Service Users radically easier.  

I put together this quick video to show off the features of the Apache Sling Service User WebConsole and show how easy it is to install and use. Enjoy!
