Tis the season for webinars! 6D will be presenting some great webinars in August. 

### 6D DPS Entitlement System Webinar

_Tuesday, August 18, 2015_  
_12:30-1:00pm EST / 9:30-10:00am PST_  

First up, [Jason Porath](http://www.6dglobal.com/about/team/jason-porath) and [Charlie Wagner](http://labs.6dglobal.com/users/charlie-wagner) will be leading a webinar introducing the new 6D DPS Entitlement System. This product integrates with Adobeâ€™s DPS and Publish platforms and allows non-technical administrators to easily manage user and group entitlement for multiple apps in an organization. We focused on its intuitive and easy to use web interface that is accessible on any device. If you are using Adobe DPS and need entitlement and even if you are using another entitlement solution, I'd check this webinar out to see how much easier it could be.
