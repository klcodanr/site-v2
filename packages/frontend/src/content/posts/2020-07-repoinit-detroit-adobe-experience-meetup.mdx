Did you miss my [webinar with the Detroit Adobe Experience Meetup on Sling RepoInit](https://blogs.perficient.com/2020/07/07/upcoming-webinar-sling-repoinit/)? Sling RepoInit is a newer technology which enables projects to set up permissions, configurations and content via OSGi configurations in a purpose-built grammar.

Check out the presentation deck and recording to see how RepoInit could be useful on your project.
