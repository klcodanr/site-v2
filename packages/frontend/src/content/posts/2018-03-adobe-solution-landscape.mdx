As a digital marketer or technologist, Adobe's technologies offer tremendous potential and impressive capabilities. But, with all the different names, teams and viewpoints from Adobe, much less the partner ecosystem, how do you keep it all straight?

This post is intended to be your introduction to the Adobe Experience Cloud solutions. Whether you are just getting started using Adobe or are a seasoned professional in one of their products, this post will help guide you to understand the current Adobe Experience Cloud solutions and their integral role in delivering a comprehensive digital experience.

## What's with All the Clouds?!?

One of the first confusion points when discussing Adobe's digital marketing solutions is all the different clouds. At Summit 2017, Adobe introduced three overarching cloud solutions to organize all of their product offerings. They are:

  
1. **Adobe Experience Cloud** \- Digital marketing offerings, including Experience Management, Analytics, Personalization and Marketing Automation
2. **Adobe Document Cloud** \- Document creation and management offerings, including PDF and forms
3. **Adobe Creative Cloud** \- Creative offerings including design, layout and media creation tools

  
This post will primarily discuss the capabilities of the Adobe Experience Cloud. However, there are several integration points between the Adobe Experience Cloud and the other cloud offerings which will be discussed.

  
### Breaking Down the Adobe Experience Cloud

  
The Adobe Experience Cloud is made up of eight primary tools and several additional tools which, together create [Adobe's market leading digital experience platform](https://www.adobe.com/modal-offers/gartner-dxp-q118.html?sdid=S36FMYH3&mv=other). This platform allows marketers to create consistent, secure and personalized experiences across multiple digital touchpoints. This can include mobile, web, portals and any other digital experience.

The Adobe Experience Cloud is subdivided into the Adobe Analytics Cloud, Adobe Advertising Cloud and Adobe Marketing Cloud. In the danger of being too honest, for purpose, these subdivisions do not matter.

To create a comprehensive digital marketing solution, you will need to integrate all of the capabilities of the Adobe Experience Cloud. Thus, let's focus on the Adobe Experience Cloud tools and their roles in delivering an integrated digital marketing platform.

  
## Understanding the Adobe Experience Cloud Solutions

  
Each solution in the Adobe Experience Cloud offers different capabilities, we'll explore each solution to understand it's role in the Adobe Experience Cloud. I've provided a very high level overview of the solutions, including alternative names and example integration points to provide a background of each solution and to help understand each solution's role.
