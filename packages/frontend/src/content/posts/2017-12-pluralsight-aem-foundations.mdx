 Adobe Experience Manager or AEM is Adobe's market leading web content management and digital marketing platform. In this course, Extending AEM Foundations, you'll learn about the fundamental concepts and architecture of AEM. Then, you'll explore installing AEM and the developer tools and configuring AEM. Finally, you'll learn about developing services, servlets, and jobs in AEM. By the end of this course, you'll have a good understanding of how to develop backend code on the AEM platform.

 This course was developed in conjunction with [Adobe Digital Learning](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/adobe-inc) and reflects the official Adobe training materials (with some added bonus content from me).
